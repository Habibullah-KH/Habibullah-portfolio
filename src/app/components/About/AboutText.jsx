          Hi, I’m <strong>Habibullah Khondoker</strong>, a passionate web developer with a  foundation in JavaScript and skilled in the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). My journey started with a deep curiosity about the web, which grew into a commitment to building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I kickstarted my programming journey with <strong>Programming Hero</strong>, where I developed a solid grasp of full-stack development through real-world, hands-on projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I’m pursuing a <strong>BSc in CSE at IUBAT</strong>. While studying, I actively work on both personal and collaborative projects to continuously improve my skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond traditional web dev, I’m also intrigued by <strong>AI-powered tools</strong>, automation, and smart solutions that elevate both everyday life and business operations.
